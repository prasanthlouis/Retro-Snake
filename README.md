Retro-Snake
===========

Snake with HTML/CSS, and JS
Use the enter key to start the game, and arrow keys to control the snake.


Bugs: 
1) If the snake is moving in a particular direction (say north), hitting the opposite key (south) would cause the game to end, even though the snake hasn't hit anything. Though normally, users wont click the opposite direction as the snake can't travel backwards, this shouldn't be used as a criteria to end the game.
